About me

My name is Marysia Kołaczyńska and I am currently living in Warsaw. I am a certified dietician. Some time ago I discovered for myself the world of programming and really got into it. I am very determined and willing to improve my skills. My professional priority is to continuously broaden and upgrade my knowledge under the guidance of experts and more experienced programmers.
